TSLK stands for Translatable Scripting Language for Kids. The whole point of this language is to offer schools the ability to teach the basics of programming in a language which is simple and understandable even to people who don't know English. TSLK will offer the ability to easily change the keywords, operators and other tokens to correspond to the local language and keyword layouts.

This project is in very early stages of development. While the goal is to provide a translatable scripting language, the current priority is to get the language working in one translation and write extensive tests for it.

The runtime is located in the src directory. Code generated by ANTLR4 and the grammar definition itself are located in src-gen. Tests are located in the tests directory. test.tslk is currently the only example of code written in TSLK.

Currently, the test suite is pretty much non-existent. Expanding it is of high priority and I am working on it.

Thank you for having a look!
